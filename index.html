          <span>CAMBRIDGE,</span>
          <p> Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new
            son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far
            beyond the world of known physics.
          </p>
          <p>
            He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been created in
            the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch
            in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy that
            exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously
            violent instant.
          </p>
          <p>
            If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to pole and
            not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities.
            Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
          </p>
          <p>“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.</p>
          <p>
            On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning of the
            Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic time with telescopes at the South
            Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected
            ripples in the
            fabric of space-time — so-called gravitational waves — the signature of a universe being wrenched violently
            apart when
            it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought
            smoking-gun
            evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered
            whether it could
            ever be proved.
          </p>
          <p>
            If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent discovery of
            dark energy
            pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and space and
            energy to science
            and speculation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space with its
            hundreds of
            billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate
            are
            unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of other universes bubbling
            into frothy
            eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.
          </p>
          <blockquote>‘As Big as It Gets’</blockquote>
          <p>In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever beyond the
            reach of
            particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the
            first direct
            observation of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should
            ruffle
            space-time.</p>
          <p>
            Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the team, said,
            “This is
            huge, as big as it gets.”
          </p>
          <p>
            He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in gravitational
            waves.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that permeates
            space and
            preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the sun.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic
            Extragalactic
            Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics here on Monday
            and in a set
            of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.

          <p>Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation, which explains how the universe

        <p>Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one in 10 million.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not expected such a definite confirmation in
          his lifetime.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          “With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have been lucky.”
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of observations and analysis. Eschewing
          email for fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select few, meeting with Dr.
          Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is his son, Larry, who was sleeping
          that night in 1979), in his office last week.

        <br>
        <p>
          “It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as scientists,” said Dr. Kovac, who chose his
          words as carefully as he tended his radio telescopes.

          Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the most popular variant of inflation, known
          as chaotic inflation, in 1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week when Chao-Lin Kuo, a
          Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s team, knocked on his door with a bottle of Champagne to tell
          him the news.

        <p>Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered anything.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
          “And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a delivery but we did not think that we
          ordered anything, but I simply forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde wrote in an
          email.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was still hyperventilating. “Having news
          like this is the best way of spoiling a vacation,” he said.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation had been seen and news spread,
          astrophysicists responded with a mixture of jubilation and caution.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think that if this stays true, it will go down as
          one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science.”
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and head of a competing project called the
          South Pole Telescope, pronounced himself deeply impressed. “I think the results are beautiful and very
          convincing,” he said.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation that posits the clash of a pair of
          universes as the cause of genesis, said that if true, the Bicep result would eliminate his model, but he
          expressed reservations about inflation.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the need for confirmation, noting that the new
          results exceeded earlier estimates based on temperature maps of the cosmic background by the European Space
          Agency’s Planck satellite and other assumptions about the universe.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          “So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr. Krauss said.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft will report its own findings this year. At
          least a dozen other teams are trying similar measurements from balloons, mountaintops and space.
        </p>
        <br>

        <strong> in the Sky</strong>
        <br>
        <p>
          Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the cosmic microwaves, which were discovered
          accidentally by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the Nobel Prize.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves. He is one of four leaders of Bicep,
          which has operated a series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole, where the thin, dry
          air creates ideal observing conditions. The others are Clement Pryke of the University of Minnesota, Jamie
          Bock of the California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          “The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on the ground,” Dr. Kovac said. He has been
          there 23 times, he said, wintering over in 1994. “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he said.
        </p>

          The Bicep2 telescope, in the foreground, was used to detect the faint spiraling

        <p>In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave radiation was polarized, meaning the light
          waves had a
          slight preference to vibrate in one direction rather than another.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
          This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational waves from inflation. Such waves,
          squeezing
          space in one direction and stretching it in another as they go by, would twist the direction of polarization
          of the
          microwaves, theorists said. As a result, maps of the polarization in the sky should have little arrows going
          in spirals.
